# Command Line ecommerce project 

## This project is a command line application involving Node.js and MySQL.



### I've created the backend of an ecommerce site similar to Amazon, eBay, or Ali Baba, where users can buy products electronically. Users interact with the application via the command line to purchase goods. As a user, I enter the product ID, and the amount of the product that I want.  This application includes a customer and a Manager view.



###Databases are great not just for storing and organizing data, but also to identify  top performing categories, or cateogries where sales improvement can be made. SQL allows for easy querying and aggregate functions, giving the manager a quick at-a-glance view of actionable information. If a product goes viral, alerts are generated when quantity is low, meaning that items will be in stock.

###Future directions include:
* recommended items
* using javascript to display notifications (modals) of trending items 

##For managers / supervisors, future directions include:
* Dashboard containing historical and forecasted data at the department level
* A/B testing
* data deep dives
* conversion rates of buyers
* converting buyers to sellers
