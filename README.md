# Command Line ecommerce project 

## This project is a command line application involving Node.js and MySQL.

##User view

### I've created the backend of an ecommerce site similar to Amazon, eBay, or Ali Baba, where users can buy products electronically. Users interact with the application via the command line to purchase goods. As a user, I enter the product ID, and the amount of the product that I want.

##Analytics capabilities

### This application also includes a Manager and Supervisor view

###Databases are great not just for storing and organizing data, but also to identify our top performing categories, or cateogries where sales improvement can be made. SQL allows for easy querying and aggregate functions, giving the manager a quick at-a-glance view of actionable information. If a product goes viral, alerts are generated when quantity is low, meaning that items will be in stock.

###Future directions include:
* generating "open cart" emails
* doing customer segmention
* targeted email lists
*recommended items
* using javascript to display notifications (modals) of trending items 

##For managers / supervisors, future directions include:
* A/B testing
* data deep dives
* conversion rates of buyers
* converting buyers to sellers
